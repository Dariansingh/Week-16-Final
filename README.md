To deploy your React JS app to GoDaddy, you will need to follow these steps:

Build your React app for production using the npm run build command in your terminal. This will create a build folder in your project directory containing the production-ready files.

Log in to your GoDaddy account and navigate to your cPanel dashboard.

In the cPanel dashboard, find the File Manager icon and click on it. This will open the File Manager tool.

Navigate to the public_html folder in your File Manager. This is the folder where you will upload your React app files.

Once you are in the public_html folder, click on the Upload button in the File Manager toolbar.

Select all the files and folders in your React app's build folder and upload them to the public_html folder.

Once the upload is complete, you should be able to access your React app by visiting your website URL in a web browser.
