Our company has grown quite a bit since we launched it back in 2020. It truly grew out of COVID. The owner lived in a home tucked away in a remote area. She wanted the best equipment for DJ and karaoke sound for her own entertainment purposes. She started doing a few regular karaoke shows, acquired valuable employees, and locating DJs with amazing backgrounds in the industry. She purchased another company with a number of DJs. This helped to expand the company into providing multiple events, many on a weekly basis. The owner used "care" in her company name due to her ownership of two companies Care Navigators and Care Guardians and her background in nursing. 

We operate this business the way it should be done with 
Integrity and ethical values. We respect our clients wishes and choices without exception. We want you to have the best possible event. We love it when you rave about us to other potential clients.
