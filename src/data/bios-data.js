        "description": "Hello World!  My handle is DJ Jimmy Jams.  I provide a pleasurable karaoke experience.  Equipped with my own lighting and a fog machine, I bring a bright and professional experience to the singers and the crowd.  I make sure everyone feels welcome and has a good time.  My singing hobby turned into a part-time job; and I love it!  I tailor the sound so everyone sounds good when they get behind that mic, or those mics (sometimes I get a crowd up on that stage).  If you’d like a memorable experience and a wonderful night, come see me at one of our shows. I look forward to meeting you.",
